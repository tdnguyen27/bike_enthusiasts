            This is an interactive Mapbox visualizing bike traffic in the Boston area during different times of the day. 
            There is the interactive feature that allows the users to pan and zoom the map, and a slider at the top right 
            that allows the user to filter the data for traffic at specific times of the day. The circles will change size 
            and color accordingly. The circles represent individual BlueBike stations. The size of each circle represents 
            the amount of traffic at each station, while the color represents whether most traffic is entering or leaving 
            the station.
